Clients scopes -    Are the scopes attached on JWT token, what scopes exactly the client has
                    Read scope, write scope, scope to see specifics fields

Realm roles -       Role admin, role to create specific resource. It is a global role
                    Each client is possible to create specifics roles

Users -             Users who belongs to the Realm
